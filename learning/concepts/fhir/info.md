## FHIR

The DSF uses a variety of [FHIR resources](https://dsf.dev/intro/info/basics.html#why-are-we-using-fhir-and-bpmn) for communication. The DSF uses XML as the format for FHIR resources.  
The most important resources for plugin development are [ActivityDefinitions](../../concepts/fhir/activitydefinition.md), [Tasks](../../concepts/fhir/task.md),
[CodeSystems](../../concepts/fhir/codesystem.md) and [ValueSets](../../concepts/fhir/valueset.md).
There is also a catalogue of DSF-specific FHIR resources including CodeSystems, ValueSets and Extensions. You can find them in the official
DSF GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/datasharingframework/dsf/tree/main/dsf-fhir/dsf-fhir-validation/src/main/resources/fhir).
