### About Versions, Placeholders and URLs

#### Version Pattern

Process plugin versions have to obey the pattern:
```
\d+\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+  Example: 1.0.1.2
```

The first two numbers (`1.0`) are used in FHIR resources and signal changes which break compatibility with previous
process versions. The latter two (`1.2`) signal changes which do not break compatibility with previous process versions. Specifically,
the 4th number is reserved for bug-fixes and the 3rd number includes all other non-breaking changes.

#### Placeholders

To avoid the need to specify the version and release date for each [ActivityDefinition](../../concepts/fhir/activitydefinition.md), [CodeSystem](../../concepts/fhir/codesystem.md),
[Task](../../concepts/fhir/task.md) profile and [ValueSet](../../concepts/fhir/valueset.md) resource,
the placeholders `#{version}` and `#{date}` can be used when creating FHIR resources or even in BPMN models.
They are replaced with the values returned by the methods `ProcessPluginDefinition#getResourceVersion`
and `ProcessPluginDefinition#getReleaseDate` respectively during deployment of a process plugin by the DSF BPE server.

#### URLs

BPMN models have an ID we call process definition key. The BPMN process definition key needs to be specified following the pattern:
```
^[-a-zA-Z0-9]+_[-a-zA-Z0-9]+$   Example: domainorg_processKey
```
In addition, the BPMN model needs to specify a version. You should be using the ``#{version}`` [placeholder](../../concepts/dsf/about-version-placeholders-and-urls.md#placeholders)
for this as well. The DSF will use the process definition key and the version specified in the BPMN model to create a
URL to refer to this specific process. Like this:
```
http://domain.org/bpe/Process/processKey|1.0
```

As you can see, the version in the URL ``|1.0`` only uses the resource version and omits the code base version.
As mentioned in [Version Pattern](about-version-placeholders-and-urls.md#version-pattern), this means that only changes to the first two
version numbers are significant to signal compatibility when communicating with other process plugin instances.

You will use the above URL as your instantiatesCanonical value for [Task](../../concepts/fhir/task.md) profile definitions as well as references
to [Task](../../concepts/fhir/task.md) profiles in other resources.
You will also use it as the URL value for your [ActivityDefinitions](../../concepts/fhir/activitydefinition.md). In this case though, you
have to split up the URL into two parts. You will separate the version (``|1.0``) from the URL and use it as a value for the
`ActivityDefinition.version` element. Since it refers to the plugin's resource version, you should also use the `#{version}`
[placeholder](about-version-placeholders-and-urls.md#placeholders) here instead. Going by the example from above, you will be left with a URL that looks
like this:
```
http://domain.org/bpe/Process/processKey
```
This will be the value for your `ActivityDefinition.url` element with `#{version}` as the value for your `ActivityDefinition.version` element.
