### Timer Intermediate Catching Events

A [Timer Intermediate Catching Event](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/7.17/reference/bpmn20/events/timer-events/#timer-intermediate-catching-event)
allows you model stopwatch behavior. A timer is started once the BPMN execution arrives at the event.
The duration until the timer runs out is specified using the [ISO 8601 Durations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Durations) format.
Examples can be found [here](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/7.17/reference/bpmn20/events/timer-events/#time-duration). After running out, the BPMN process executes the [Sequence Flow](../../concepts/bpmn/sequence-flow.md) following
the [Timer Intermediate Catching Event](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/7.17/reference/bpmn20/events/timer-events/#timer-intermediate-catching-event).
