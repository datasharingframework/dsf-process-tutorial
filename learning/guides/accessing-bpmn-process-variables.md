### Accessing BPMN Process Variables

After creating a [Service Delegate](../concepts/dsf/service-delegates.md) or [Message Delegate](../concepts/dsf/message-delegates.md), you might want to
retrieve data from or store data in the [BPMN process variables](../concepts/dsf/bpmn-process-variables.md).
You can achieve this through the `Variables` class.
The `Variables` class provides lots of utility methods to read or write certain types
of [BPMN process variables](../concepts/dsf/bpmn-process-variables.md). If for some reason you find the methods provided by the `Variables` class insufficient
to solve your problem, we would like to learn how the current API of the `Variables` class is limiting you. Contact us, and we might turn it into a feature request ([Contribute](https://dsf.dev/stable/contribute)).
