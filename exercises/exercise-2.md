# Exercise 2 - Environment Variables and Input Parameters
BPMN processes might require additional information during execution, e.g. for configuration purposes. 
We will take a look at two possibilities on how to pass additional information to a BPMN process: Environment Variables and Input Parameters.   
The goal of this exercise is to enhance the `dsfdev_dicProcess` by trying them both. 
In both cases the information will be available in the `doExecute` method of your service class.

In order to solve this exercise, you should have solved the first exercise and read the topics on
[Environment Variables](../learning/concepts/dsf/environment-variables.md), 
[Task Input Parameters](../learning/concepts/fhir/task.md#task-input-parameters),
[Accessing Task Resources During Execution](../learning/guides/accessing-task-resources-during-execution.md),
[Placeholders](../learning/concepts/dsf/about-version-placeholders-and-urls.md#placeholders) and
[Read Access Tag](../learning/concepts/dsf/read-access-tag.md).

Solutions to this exercise are found on the branch `solutions/exercise-2`.


## Exercise Tasks
1. Add a new boolean variable to the `TutorialConfig` class. It will enable/disable logging and have its value injected from an environment variable. Add the annotation and specify the default value as `false`. You may freely choose a name for your environment variable here. Just make sure you follow the naming convention explained earlier.
2. Modify the constructor of the `DicTask` class to use the newly created variable. Don't forget to change the `DicTask` bean in `TutorialConfig`.
3. Use the value of the environment variable in the `DicTask` class to decide whether the log message from exercise 1 should be printed.
4. Add the new environment variable to the `dic-bpe` service in `dev-setup/docker-compose.yml` and set the value to `"true"`.
5. Create a new [CodeSystem](../learning/concepts/fhir/codesystem.md) with url `http://dsf.dev/fhir/CodeSystem/tutorial` having a concept with code `tutorial-input`. Don't forget to add the `read-access-tag`.

   `tutorial-process/src/main/resources/fhir/CodeSystem`.
   </details>

6. Create a new [ValueSet](../learning/concepts/fhir/valueset.md) with url `http://dsf.dev/fhir/ValueSet/tutorial` that includes all concepts from the [CodeSystem](../learning/concepts/fhir/codesystem). Don't forget to add the `read-access-tag`.

   `tutorial-process/src/main/resources/fhir/ValueSet`.
   </details>

7. Add a new input parameter of type `tutorial-input` with `Task.input.value[x]` as a `string` to the `task-start-dic-process.xml` [Task](../learning/concepts/fhir/task.md) profile.

   <summary>Don't how to add a new input parameter?</summary>

   Check out [this guide](../learning/guides/adding-task-input-parameters-to-task-profiles.md).
   </details>

8. `task-start-dic-process` and by extension the process `dsfdev_dicProcess` now require additional FHIR resources. Make sure the return value for `TutorialProcessPluginDefinition#getFhirResourcesByProcessId` also includes the new [CodeSystem](../learning/concepts/fhir/codesystem.md) and [ValueSet](../learning/concepts/fhir/valueset.md) resources for the `dsfdev_dicProcess`.
9. Read the new input parameter in the `DicTask` class from the start [Task](../learning/concepts/fhir/task.md) and add the value to the log message from exercise 1.
   <details>
   <summary>Don't know how to get the input parameter?</summary>
   
   The `TaskHelper` instance will prove useful here. Use it in conjunction with `variables` to get the right Task resource from the BPMN process execution.
   </details>
10. We just changed the elements a Task resource has to include. So you need to change `example-task.xml` for [cURL](../learning/guides/starting-a-process-via-task-resources.md#using-curl) or `Task/task-start-dic-process.xml`, if you want to use the web interface, to include the new input parameter. The actual value may be any arbitrary string.

## Solution Verification
### Maven Build and Automated Tests
Execute a maven build of the `dsf-process-tutorial` parent module via:

```
mvn clean install -Pexercise-2
```

Verify that the build was successful and no test failures occurred.

### Process Execution and Manual Tests
To verify the `dsfdev_dicProcess` can be executed successfully, we need to deploy it into a DSF instance and execute the process. The maven `install` build is configured to create a process jar file with all necessary resources and copy the jar to the appropriate locations of the docker dev setup.

1. Start the DSF FHIR server for the `Test_DIC` organization in a console at location `.../dsf-process-tutorial/dev-setup`:
   ```
   docker-compose up dic-fhir
   ```
   Verify the DSF FHIR server started successfully.

2. Start the DSF BPE server for the `Test_DIC` organization in second console at location `.../dsf-process-tutorial/dev-setup`:
   ```
   docker-compose up dic-bpe
   ```
   Verify the DSF BPE server started successfully and deployed the `dsfdev_dicProcess`.

3. Start the `dsfdev_dicProcess` by posting an appropriate FHIR [Task](../learning/concepts/fhir/task.md) resource to the DSF FHIR server of the `Test_DIC` organization using either cURL or the DSF FHIR server's web interface. Check out [Starting A Process Via Task Resources](../learning/guides/starting-a-process-via-task-resources.md) again if you are unsure.

   Verify that the `dsfdev_dicProcess` was executed by the DSF BPE server. The BPE server should:
    * Print a message showing that the process was started.
    * If logging is enabled - print the log message and the value of the input parameter you added to the `DicTask`
      implementation.
    * Print a message showing that the process finished.
    
  Check that you can disable logging of your message by modifying the `docker-compose.yml` file and configuring your environment variable with the value `"false"` or removing the environment variable.  
  _Note: Changes to environment variable require recreating the docker container._
  
  Also check that modification to the [Task](../learning/concepts/fhir/task.md) input parameter specified in the `TutorialExampleStarter` class, have the appropriate effect on your log message.
